# OVERWATCHER_2.0, a ground up redesign of my old Discord bot

The first iteration of this bot was poorly coded and did not implement all of the functionality I originally intended. This rendition, built with stricter and more intuitive coding practices in mind, will eventually include newer commands and a more consistent performance.

# Commands

_To be added once implemented..._

# Bot invite link
